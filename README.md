# RESTFight

RESTFight is a turn based robot AI programming game. Players controls their robots via REST API which means any language can be used to write the AI. This repo provides a game server.

The game also offers a viewer app to follow the robot fight in real time.

## Roadmap

**Game is currently higly WIP.** And as all side projects this project won't never be finished :) However the first step will be a super simple MVP version wich only supports robot movement. In the MVP version the idea is to try to avoid obstacles and find an exit door.
